# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Ruby. The game is played in the terminal, and the objective is to control the snake to eat the food and grow as long as possible without hitting the walls or itself.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Ruby installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command in your terminal:
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement. The game will continue until the snake hits a wall or itself. After the game ends, you can choose to play again or exit.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following parameters in the `snake_game.rb` file:

- `BOARD_WIDTH` and `BOARD_HEIGHT`: Set the size of the game board.
- `INITIAL_SNAKE_LENGTH`: Set the initial length of the snake.
- `SNAKE_SPEED`: Set the speed of the snake's movement.
- `SNAKE_BODY_CHAR` and `SNAKE_HEAD_CHAR`: Customize the appearance of the snake on the board.
- `FOOD_CHAR`: Customize the appearance of the food on the board.

Feel free to experiment and make changes to enhance your game!
